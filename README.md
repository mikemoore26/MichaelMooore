# Michael Moore
## Data Science Student

My name is Michael Moore. I graduated at Farmingdale State College with a Bachelor’s in Computer Programming and Information System in December 2015. I’ve spent most my time post college learning more about IT and eventually was able to get an A+ certification which I used to do multiple jobs in the field of IT. Now I am taking Data Science class with Tech I.S. which so far help me learn python, SQL, numpy, and so much more to come.
